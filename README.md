### Logistic Map and Lyapunov Exponent

The **logistic map** is a mathematical model used to describe the dynamic behavior of nonlinear systems. It is expressed by the equation:

$x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n)$

where \( x_n \) represents the system's state at time \( n \), and \( r \) is the control parameter. The logistic map was introduced by Pierre Fran√ßois Verhulst in 1838 to model population growth, but it later became important in the study of chaotic systems. As the value of \( r \) changes, the system's behavior can shift from stability to chaos. Specifically:

- For \( r \) small (less than 1), the population tends to zero.
- For \( r \) between 1 and 3, the system reaches a stable equilibrium.
- For \( r \) between 3 and 3.57, periodic oscillations (bifurcations) occur.
- For \( r \) values greater than 3.57, the system becomes chaotic, exhibiting unpredictable behavior highly sensitive to initial conditions.

The **Lyapunov exponent** is a measure of the rate of divergence or convergence of nearby trajectories in a dynamical system. It is used to quantify the system's sensitivity to initial conditions, which is a hallmark of chaos. 

When the Lyapunov exponent is positive, the system's trajectories diverge exponentially, indicating chaotic behavior. If it is negative, the system is stable and the trajectories converge, while a zero exponent suggests the system is periodic or non-chaotic but not necessarily stable.

For the logistic map, the Lyapunov exponent can be used to determine in which intervals of \( r \) the system behaves chaotically. In regions where the system is chaotic, the Lyapunov exponent will be positive.
